=head1 NAME

Pipefy::Client -- An object that can be used to manipulate the Pipefy API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $client = Pipefy::Client->new({ api_key => $hub_api_key }); 
 # Retrieve 50 contacts
 my $contacts = $client->contacts(50);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was created for internal needs. At the moment it does what I need it to do, which is to say not very much. However it is a decent enough framework for adding functionality to, so your contributions to extend it to what you need it to do are welcome.

At the moment you can only retrieve read-only representations of contact objects.

=item new({api_key => <api_key_for_your hub> }) (constructor)

This class is what you use to perform actions against the API. Once you have created an instance of this object, you can call the other methods below on it. If you don't specify an API key it will connect to the demo Pipefy hub. Since this is shared by everyone on the internet, don't be surprised if you start to see 429 errors getting returned. See L<Rate limits|https://developers.hubspot.com/apps/api_guidelines>. 

Returns: new instance of this class.

=item contact_by_id()

Retrieve a single contact record by its ID. Takes one parameter, which is the ID of the contact you want to retrieve. The returned object will contain all the properties set on that object.

 my $contact = $client->contact_by_id('897654');

Returns: L<Pipefy::Contact>, or undef if the contact wasn't found.

}

=item contacts()

Retrieve all contact records. Takes one optional parameter, which is the number of contacts you want to retrieve. The returned objects will contain a few of the properties set on that object. See L<Pipefy::Client/properties>.

 my $contact = $client->contacts();
 my $contact = $client->contacts(200);

Returns: L<Pipefy::Contact>
